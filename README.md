This is wiki on how to install the PolarPopSMP<br>

## Download the modpack
You can download the modpack from [here](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/polar-pop-mc/files)<br>
There are 3 versions: No shaders, Full pack and no visuals. They are what their name suggest. The first one has no shaders, the second one has all the stuff including the visuals and the last one does not contain any visual mods (basicly the stuff you do not need)<br>

## Install launcher for modding

### Windows
Download Curseforge from [here](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app) or Prism launcher from [here](https://prismlauncher.org/download/)<br>

If you are going to follow the tutorial above on linux instead of downloading the installer, if you are on debian based flavours, I would reccomend installing it using apt command:<br>
```
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk openjdk-17-jre
```

### Prism launcher
Click on "file" (top right) -> "add Instance" -> "Import from zip".<br>
