If you are going to follow the tutorial above on linux instead of downloading the installer, I would reccomend installing it using apt command:<br>
```
apt install openjdk-17-jdk openjdk-17-jre
```

Open Minecraft tab from the main menu, then click on "Create custom profile" (top right) ->  click on "Import" (upper side of the menu) -> select the .zip file<br>
